# Implementation Summary

## Database Architecture
- **Normalized PostgreSQL Schema**: Designed with 5 main entities (Teams, Games, Players, Shots, Passes, Turnovers)
- **Relationships**: Proper foreign key relationships ensuring data integrity
- **Spatial Data**: X,Y coordinates stored for all location-based events
- **Action Types**: Categorized by basketball play types (pickAndRoll, isolation, postUp, offBallScreen)

## Data Loading Process
- **Script Location**: `backend/scripts/load_data.py`
- **Idempotent Design**: Can be run repeatedly without duplicating data
- **Data Summary**: 
  - 10 Teams
  - 39 Games  
  - 10 Players
  - 192 Shots
  - 165 Passes
  - 14 Turnovers

## API Implementation
- **Player Summary Stats**: Aggregates all player statistics from database
- **Ranking System**: Calculates player ranks against all players for each statistic
- **Endpoint**: `GET /api/v1/playerSummary/{playerID}`
- **Response Format**: Matches the sample data structure exactly

## Key Features
1. **Database Export**: `dbexport.pgsql` contains complete database state
2. **Error Handling**: Proper validation and error responses
3. **Performance**: Efficient database queries with proper indexing
4. **Maintainability**: Clean, documented code with Django best practices

## Testing
- All functions tested and working correctly
- API endpoint returns proper JSON responses
- Database queries optimized for performance
- Data integrity maintained through foreign key constraints
